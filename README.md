This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio site. I built it to showcase my personal projects and tech interests, as well as to create new opportunities for myself as a developer. My goal with this project was to learn and implement at least one or two new (to me) technologies. I started by setting up a TypeScript React App with Vite, a next-gen build tool I've been hearing great things about.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- ViteJS
- React
- Chakra-UI
- Framer Motion
- CSS-Doodle

## Design Credits

- The site background design is adapted from a CSS-Doodle by [Alisa Kin](https://codepen.io/alisasila)
- The header font animation is based on a concept from [HÃ¥vard Brynjulfsen](https://codepen.io/havardob)
- Overall design inspired by The Odin Project's Personal Portfolio [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/873/project_submissions)
- Icons created by [Icons8](https://icons8.com)
